# The Goumi Berry Guide

The Goumi Berry Guide is a public educational resource focused on goumi berries (*Elaeagnus multiflora*), an under-documented fruiting shrub with growing interest among growers, orchardists, and agroforestry practitioners.

The project is published by **Goumi Berry Research** and is structured as a reference rather than a commercial site.

## Scope

The guide currently covers:
- What goumi berries are and how they differ from similar fruits
- Flavor development, ripening behavior, and harvest timing
- Growing characteristics and resilience in diverse conditions
- Post-harvest handling and potential uses
- Research notes and trial summaries

## Primary resource
